# Initial Brief Survey and Ideas



## 17 Goals

A permaculture village would likely also want to target most if not
all of the [UN's sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) (as a
side note, the high level political forum for these is an interesting browse:
[https://hlpf.un.org/](https://hlpf.un.org/)). These could be taken as the
output variables/metrics of interest in a simulation

(Note that for each of these the "targets and indicators" sections are very
useful)

1. **No poverty** - unsure exactly how to apply this, the targets for this are
   mostly external to a wouldbe village itself.
2. **End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and sustainable
   agriculture** - a village that can feed itself and feed itself well. This
   includes maintaining genetic diversity of seeds and plants and managing
   impact on ecosystems.
3. **Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing** - may be similar to 1, this
   has ties to the larger system - a village wouldn't be able to manage its own
   healthcare very well, it can't do this in a vacuum. For goals like these, how
   does a village ensure its members have access to the care of this larger
   system, how do they participate in greater politics to ensure it improves and
   so forth?
4. **Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education, lifelong learning for
   all** - how well is information/knowledge (implicit and explicit) organized
   and passed on? How well is edcuation outside village brought in and
   integrated? May in part be like goals 1 and 3. How do we educate for
   sustainable lifestyles, "global citizenship" so forth (I really like target
   4.7)
5. **Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls** - This speaks to
   a larger problem of how does one ensure a small community does not become
   particularly extreme/descriminatory in general? Definitely seems like a
   concern especially if heavy decentralization becomes a thing.
6. **Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation** -
   appropriate water and resource management (no exquisitely cared for grass
   lawns!)
7. **Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable energy** - like 1, 3, 6,
   many external variables.
8. **Promote sustainable economic growth, employment, and decent work** - things
   like encouraging entrepreneurship, innovation, small enterprises etc. I like
   8.4, "decouple economic growth from environmental degradation"
9. **Resilient infrastructure, sustainable industrialiazation, and foster
   innovation** - Like 1, 3, 6, 7?
10. **Reduce inequality within and among countries** - Maybe not this one, this
    seems entirely outside of the scope of a village to even partcipate in.
11. **Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and
    sustainable** - Yep! That's the whole point of a permaculture village! More
    seriously though this definitely feels like 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, larger scope
    discussing affordable housing, public transportation, but also includes
    things like access to green public spaces and so on. 11.a interesting with
    regards to developing good plans/links between urban and rural areas. Can
    permaculture villages of various types bridge that gap?
12. **Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns** - some is maybe
    out of scope, but includes things like food waste, efficient use of natural
    resources, waste management, lifestyles, and access to information about
    best practices and so on.
13. **Urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts** - things like
    resilience and education and in general taking measures to combat climate
    change, somewhat out of scope. 
14. **Conserve and sustainable use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for
    sustainable development** - maybe only applicable for coastal villages?
    Interesting to consider as a variable, largely difficult scope?
15. **Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems,
    sustainable manage forests, combat desertification, and halt/reverse land
    degradation/biodiversity loss** - whew that's a big one, like 14 but more
    applicable to more locations. A lot of these targets do seem like things a
    village in the right location could _contribute_ to.
16. **Promote peaceful inclusive societies, access to justice, effective
    accountable institutions at all levels.** - difficult to scope, but this
    might include things like participation in local politics and so on. Targets
    include things like reduced violence, abuse, corruption, effective
    institutions so on and so forth. Possibility to include small governance
    options like sociocracy?
17. **Strengthen the means of implementation for sustainable development** - out
    of scope but important to consider.


## Notes

Realizing from a lot of those goals and focusing on definition of permaculture,
while some level of decentralization is important and good (especially from
resiliency standpoint and many times ecological[citations needed]), it's
important to remember this does _not_ mean a village cut off from the rest of
the world and it's systems, but more an emphasis on balanced and sustainable
local ecology, basically solarpunk.

There are SDG reports throughout the past many years, could use the indicators
to predict trends as variables tying into the models, e.g.
[https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2022/](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2022/) and again see [https://hlpf.un.org/](https://hlpf.un.org/) for other progress charts and so on.
